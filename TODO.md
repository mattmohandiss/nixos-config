# TODO

## üîß System Improvements (Medium Priority)

### Choose Steam Configuration Approach
Decide between system-level Steam (`system/gaming.nix`) or user-level Steam override (`mattm/applications/gaming.nix`). Having both can cause conflicts.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Tasks

### Consider Browser Configuration Consolidation
Firefox and Zen Browser have nearly identical configurations. Consider if you need both browsers or if configs can be consolidated to reduce maintenance.

### Verify Boot Configuration Consistency
Check that LUKS device UUIDs in `system/boot.nix` and `system/hardware-configuration.nix` are consistent and correct. Ensure encryption setup is properly configured.

### Review Crash Dump Settings
Evaluate if crash dump with `crashkernel=256M` in `system/boot.nix` is still needed or if memory allocation should be adjusted for your system's requirements.

## üñ•Ô∏è Hardware & Firmware

### Update Surface Pro Firmware
Use USB to boot into Windows to update firmware for better hardware compatibility and performance.

### Test Surface Pro 8 Features
Test and optimize Surface Pro 8 specific settings including touch input, pen functionality, and stylus features.

### Configure External Monitor Setup
Set up external monitor configuration for docking/undocking workflows to improve productivity when using external displays.

## üîí Security & Maintenance

### Set Up Automatic System Updates
Configure automatic system updates and maintenance schedule to keep the system secure and up-to-date.

### Configure Backup Strategy
Set up backup strategy for `/etc/nixos` configuration and home directory to prevent data loss.

### Set Up Nix Garbage Collection
Configure automatic Nix garbage collection schedule to manage disk space and remove old system generations.

### Review SSH Configuration
Review and harden SSH configuration for better security if SSH access is needed.

### Configure Automatic Security Updates
Set up automatic security updates to ensure critical security patches are applied promptly.

## üé® User Experience

### Configure Notification System
Set up and configure the notification system (mako is installed but may need configuration) for better desktop experience.

### Consider Pawbar Alternative
Evaluate using pawbar instead of waybar for the status bar as mentioned in original TODO.

### Improve Script Organization and Dependencies
Consider moving scripts from `/etc/nixos/mattm/scripts` to a proper bin directory in the user's PATH for better organization. Verify that all wallpaper and other scripts have proper dependency declarations and error handling.

### Add Documentation Comments
Add comments to complex configurations (especially Surface Pro kernel parameters) explaining why each setting is needed for future reference.

### Document MCP Server Setup
Add documentation for the MCP test server configuration and consider expansion if more MCP tools are planned. The current setup in `mattm/mcp/configuration.nix` could benefit from usage examples and development guidelines.
